PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in 
their search engine results. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance 
of website pages. 

How does it work?
PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to 
determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying 
assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from 
other websites.
